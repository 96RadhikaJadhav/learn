What is Ada and SPARK?
-----------------------

Ada is a state-of-the art programming language that development teams worldwide
are using for critical software: from microkernels and small-footprint,
real-time embedded systems to large-scale enterprise applications, and
everything in between.

SPARK is formally analyzable subset of Ada â€” and toolset that brings
mathematics-based confidence to software verification.
