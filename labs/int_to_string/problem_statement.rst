Integer to String
==================

Write a function that converts an Integer to a String, without using
the 'Image attribute.

Start with positive numbers, then all signed integers.

.. code:: ada

    with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

    procedure Main is
    begin
       Put_Line ("Not implemented yet!");
    end Main;
